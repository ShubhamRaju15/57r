<h2><b>PROJECTS</b></h2>
<ul>
<li><b>
Illumination system in an opencast coal mining project </b></li>
</ul>
<p style="color:blue;">This project aimed to comprehensively evaluate and optimize illumination strategies within such 
environments to mitigate hazards and enhance overall working conditions. The project involved a multi-faceted 
approach, beginning with a thorough assessment of existing illumination systems and conditions within an 
operational open-cast coal mining site. Various parameters such as lighting intensity, distribution, color temperature 
and ergonomic considerations were meticulously analyzed. Advanced lighting simulation software was employed to 
model different scenarios and assess the impact of proposed changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Impact of Explosive charge quantity on Rock Fragmentation Using Strayos Software</b></li>
</ul>
<p style="color:blueviolet;">The project utilized Strayos, a powerful software solution designed for analyzing and optimizing blasting 
operations. Initially, various geological parameters including rock type, density, and structure were inputted into the 
software to create accurate virtual models of the blasting site. Different scenarios were then simulated by adjusting 
the quantity of explosive charges while keeping other parameters constant.  </p>
